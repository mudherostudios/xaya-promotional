# Unofficial Xaya Promotional Material
Collection of models, sounds, textures, videos, and scripts for making splash screens in game and other promotional media. Open to the public. No licensing from us required. But you may want to contact the Xaya team before you use their logo or any of their trademarked material in your products.

- The models have only been tested in Unity3D and Blender. 
- If you notice any problems on other platforms or renderers, let us know and we'll see if we can fix them.
