# Unofficial Xaya Promotional Material
Collection of models, sounds, textures, videos, and scripts for making splash screens in game and other promotional media. Open to the public. No licensing from us required. But you may want to contact the Xaya team before you use their logo or any of their trademarked stuff in your products.

All of this material will likely be created by Mud Hero Studios, more specifically Joshua Torgerson and Johnny Sandoval our modeller and graphic artist.
